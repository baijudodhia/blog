### Current Account & Savings Account (CASA)
```
A current account savings account (CASA) is aimed at combining the features of savings and checking accounts to entice customers to keep their money in the bank.
It pays very low or no interest on the current account and an above-average return on the savings portion.
CASA is most commonly used in West and Southeast Asia, though the CASA structure is available globally.
```

### CASA Ratio
```
CASA Ratio is the ratio of deposits in current account and savings account to the total deposits of the bank.
A higher CASA ratio means that the bank has a higher share of deposits in current and savings accounts.
