## Terminology related to Finance with their meanings/description.

### Bounced Cheque [Banking]
```
A bounced check is slang for a check that cannot be processed because the account holder has nonsufficient funds (NSF) available for use.
Banks return, or "bounce", these checks, also known as rubber checks, rather than honoring them, and banks charge the check writers NSF fees.
When a check bounces, users are not honored by the depositor's bank, and may result in fees and banking restrictions. Additional penalties for bouncing checks may include negative credit score marks, refusal of merchants from accepting your checks, and potentially legally trouble.
Banks often offer overdraft protection to prevent inadvertent check bouncing.
```

### Current Account & Savings Account (CASA) [Banking]
```
A current account savings account (CASA) is aimed at combining the features of savings and checking accounts to entice customers to keep their money in the bank.
It pays very low or no interest on the current account and an above-average return on the savings portion.
CASA is most commonly used in West and Southeast Asia, though the CASA structure is available globally.
```

### CASA Ratio [Banking]
```
CASA Ratio is the ratio of deposits in current account and savings account to the total deposits of the bank.
A higher CASA ratio means that the bank has a higher share of deposits in current and savings accounts.
```

### Monthly Average Balance (MAB) [Banking]
```
Monthly Average Balance (MAB), also known as the Minimum Average Balance is nothing but the minimum amount you are required to maintain in your Savings Account every month.
The figure is calculated at the end of each month and failure to maintain this minimum average balance will result in penalties.
```

### Quarterly Average Balance (QAB) [Banking]
```
QAB is the average of the all the closing day balance of a bank account in a given quarter.
To calculate the QAB, add up all the closing day balance for the given quarter and divide it by the number of days in that quarter.
Savings account holders are required to maintain a minimum QAB in their bank account and failing to do so would amount to a penalty charge.
QAB requirements are different for different banks. It also depends on the account holder's location i.e. urban, semi-urban or rural and the category of the account.
