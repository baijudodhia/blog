### Angel Investment
```
An angel round is typically a small round designed to get a new company off the ground. Investors in an angel round include individual angel investors, angel investor groups, friends, and family.
```

### Convertible Note
```
A convertible note is an ‘in-between’ round funding to help companies hold over until they want to raise their next round of funding. When they raise the next round, this note ‘converts’ with a discount at the price of the new round. You will typically see convertible notes after a company raises, for example, a Series A round but does not yet want to raise a Series B round.
```

### Corporate Round
```
A corporate round occurs when a company, rather than a venture capital firm, makes an investment in another company. These are often, though not necessarily, done for the purpose of forming a strategic partnership.
```

### Debt Financing
```
In a debt round, an investor lends money to a company, and the company promises to repay the debt with added interest.
```

### Equity Crowdfunding
```
Equity crowdfunding platforms allow individual users to invest in companies in exchange for equity. Typically on these platforms the investors invest small amounts of money, though syndicates are formed to allow an individual to take a lead on evaluating an investment and pooling funding from a group of individual investors.
```

### Funding Rounds
```
A funding round is anytime money is raised from one or more investors for a business.
```

### Initial coin offering (ICO)
```
An initial coin offering (ICO) is a means of raising money via crowdfunding using cryptocurrency as capital. A company raising money through an ICO holds a fundraising campaign, and during this campaign, backers will purchase a percentage of a new cryptocurrency (called a “token” or “coin”), often using another cryptocurrency like bitcoin to make the purchase, in the hopes that the new cryptocurrency grows in value.
```

### Market
```
A market domain is as a segment of a broader industry with a strategic focus or target of meeting a particular business or customer need in the marketplace.
```

### Non-Equity Assistance
```
A non-equity assistance round occurs when a company or investor provides office space or mentorship and does not get equity in return.
```

### Pre-seed Funding
```
A Pre-Seed round is a pre-institutional seed round that either has no institutional investors or is a very low amount, often below $150k.
```

### Private Equity
```
Private equity is an alternative investment class and consists of capital that is not listed on a public exchange. Private equity is composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity.
```

### Post IPO Debt
```
A post-IPO debt round takes place when firms loan a company money after the company has already gone public. Similar to debt financing, a company will promise to repay the principal as well as added interest on the debt.
```

### Post IPO Equity
```
A post-IPO equity round takes place when firms invest in a company after the company has already gone public.
```

### Post IPO Secondary
```
A post-IPO secondary round takes place when an investor purchases shares of stock in a company from other, existing shareholders rather than from the company directly, and it occurs after the company has already gone public.
```

### Product Crowdfunding
```
In a product crowdfunding round, a company will provide its product, which is often still in development, in exchange for capital. This kind of round is also typically completed on a funding platform.
```

### Round (or Series) A and B
```
Series A and Series B rounds are funding rounds for earlier stage companies and range on average between $1M–$30M.
```

### Round (or Series) C to H
```
Series C to H rounds and onwards are for later stage and more established companies. These rounds are usually $10M+ and are often much larger.
```

### Seed Funding
```
Seed rounds are among the first rounds of funding a company will receive, generally while the company is young and working to gain traction. Round sizes range between $10k–$2M, though larger seed rounds have become more common in recent years. A seed round typically comes after an angel round (if applicable) and before a company’s Series A round.
```

### Startup Grant
```
Startup grants consist of a sum of money that groups offer to small companies and nonprofits to help them with their work. A Grant is when a company, investor, or government agency provides capital to a company without taking an equity stake in the company. Grants aren’t like loans. Organizations don’t have to put up collateral or pay late fees or interest. In fact, organizations don’t have to pay back grants at all. Essentially, the money is free.
```

### Total Funding
```
The total funding is the sum of all the funds received by the startup from the start of it's inception till date including all types of funding.
```

### Undisclosed Funding
```
It the funding amount which is not disclosed in any public domain and is only known to the fund raiser and the fund provider.
```

### Venture Funding
```
Venture funding refers to an investment that comes from a venture capital firm and describes Series A, Series B, and later rounds. This funding type is used for any funding round that is clearly a venture round but where the series has not been specified.
